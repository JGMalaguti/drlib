David Robinson's Personal R Package
--------------------------

This is the [personal R package](http://hilaryparker.com/2013/04/03/personal-r-packages/) of [David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org), a Data Scientist at Stack Overflow.

I'm making this public for my own convenience, without any guarantees. Functions are documented, though.
